# Rust-CLI-P2P-Chat-with-libp2p-and-Tokio
A simple CLI-based P2P chat application built using libp2p and Tokio in Rust. The project is currently a work in progress and requires several updates to improve its functionality and usability. Planned updates include:

Enhanced error handling.

Nickname generation and validation according to defined rules (e.g., no spaces, only alphanumeric characters).

Cross-machine communication to enable users to chat not just locally but also over the network, using NAT traversal techniques like STUN or TURN.

Private rooms for creating secure chat spaces that only authorized participants can join.

Main menu interface to allow users to easily navigate through options like joining a chat, creating a room, and updating profile settings.

Future development will focus on improving these features and making the chat more stable and user-friendly.
